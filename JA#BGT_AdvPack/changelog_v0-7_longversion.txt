-englische Version des BWP Textpacks korrekturgelesen und integriert


-fixed transitions of added reply options to Noralee's dialogue

-added tph/func_fetch_journal_entries.tph to ALWAYS block (argent77's READ_JOURNAL_STRREF function)

-used READ_JOURNAL_STRREF for diary_tph/aldeth.tph. Changed ja#aldeth.d to use the strings from READ_JOURNAL_STRREF

-added fix for reply option to ALDETH 5 that was cancelled by bg1npc's Viconia interjection if BG1NPC is installed first (using STATE_WHICH_SAYS, will only work as long as bg1npc doesn't change this interjection in some way.)

-if bg1npc is not installed, the ids_entries_cleanup.tph is included (taken from bg1npc)

-Aldeth and the Mearchant's League: changed reward for helping Aldeth against Seniyad to unique mod quest item always (before, the mod quest item was not given if mod quest path was chosen - I assume this was an oversight). Also, changed patching so all instances of quest reward in Aldeth.dlg are patched with mod quest item.

-gave Jopi a dialogue state if talked to again before chapter 5 (added trigger to an existing one)

Händlerligaquest:
-JA#MGUAR.baf - added scriptblock so the guards in Merchants' League attack hostile doppelgangers
-Irlentree will remain at ground floor after the greeting (fixes bug of disappeared Irlentree in case of doppelgangers got hostile)
-Aldeth will not go upstairs in case the doppelgangers changed form before the PC found any evidence against Zorl and Irlentree (fixes bug where Aldeth would say he will go upstairs but disappeared)
-added dialogue state to aldeth.dlg so that the bodies of Zorl and Irlentree can be handed to him after finishing the quest (only before chapter 8) Note: bodies only spawn in second floor if Irlentree called all guests to teh "feasts" during the quest
-fixed Zorl's dialogue if the PC comes to 2nd level alone but has the letter (scrl2p)
-AR7800.baf: removed the second script block that spawns the FF in case Deagan is rejected, and removed the REPLACE_TEXTUALLY for the original one - works as intended. Added Continue() to script block in AR7800.baf
-added possibility to talk with Aldeth about his sellout
-added compatibility with Baldurdash: Aldeth's store for chapter 8
-Zorls dead body's weight was changed from 0 to 80
-added possibility to ask bartender about information later
(-JA#DEAGA.baf: added DestroySelf() for ~Global("JA#CUDED","AR7228",2) Global("JA#ALDETHCHP8","GLOBAL",2)~ just in case he spawned but didn't talk to the PC yet but the PC already was betrayed by Aldeth)

-changed position of Nelfas Vroc to 1122.396 to move him out of the other prisoner

-removed "SHOUT" override script from JA#HUSAM.cre (to stop him from turning hostile with the guards)
-JAP's Husam in front of Palace will now disappear in case the PC didn't take his help inside the Palace

-removed "SHOUT" override script from JA#SSELF.CRE (Naiduja in the Sorcerous Sundries) to prevent her from getting hostile together with the mages

added SetGlobal("JA#LOWLG","GLOBAL",1) to JA#LOWLG.D state "5" to prevent possible looping just in case the PC managed to sneak pst him before killing Yago

-added a possibility to Krammoch to ask him for the key without threatening him or stealing it from him (ja#arkhs.d)

-tweaked ja#hulrik.d a little (state triggers and weights) to make it compatible with Miloch's Xvart Caverns in the install order JAP - XC

-following content will be skipped if via NTotSC or UB detected:
- Keelor & Nasha 
- Sylast, der Gefallene Paladin 
- Pilar und Gheldehar 
- Llyndellyn der Bogenschütze 
- Nim Furlwing und ihre Jagdhunde 
- Mal-Kalen, der geist aus Ulcaster 
- Elfsong Tavern Movie 

-Phandalyn - remove from original game area is more compatible in case other mods made changes to the area

-Phandalyn - removed patching of custom script name as it is not used

-Gervisse & Voltine: if JAP is installed after bg1npc, the quest will be compatible with bg1npc and Faldorn will have her interjection.

-Krammoch: now gives amululett "Basiliskenzähmer" as a quest reward

-because of compatibility changes concerning bg1npc: former "fixes" are removed.

-compatibility with Garrick - Tales of a Troubadour:
-Tenya will only talk about the quest if She didn't flirt with Garrick before. This solves some dialogue hickups in connection with GToaT

-changed script name patching of FLAMVAI.cre to "FLAMVAI" to make it consistent with possible other mods

-changed patched script name of ENDER.CRE to "ENDER" (same as bg1npc)

changes from 0.7 beta to 0.7.0:
-Aldeth and the druids: if BG1NPC Jaheira quest follows after JAP's peaceful solution, the journal will no longer state that Aldeth was killed
-compatibility with Garrick Tales of a Troubadour: if settling the dispute between Dryad and the woodcutters peacefully (JAP), Garrick will get the improved flute (garrick-tt).
-hurt merchant at Coast Way should only react if player healed him with a spell or gave him a healing item. If the merchant dies, a rep decrease by 1 was added.
-Nasha's temple will only be patched to Dock's District if component "Keelor&Nasha" is installed (no more CTD after going through a wrongly patched door)
-extended Mearchants' League quest: the merchant on the 2nd floor shouldn't talk about their suspicions after the quest is solved.
-talking to Commoner (MTOB5.cre) after hearing the rumor won't reset the quest variable
-compatibility to Fields of the Dead: install no longer fails if FotD BGT-version is installed
-removed Portrait Component due to unclear copyright status.
-updated readme
-update to WeiDU v244
