/* #974 */
@2    = ~Some of the clan has moved to the next objective. Jased is leading them. I almost pity the humans. They'll be cattle to be butchered.~
/* #975 */
@3    = ~The primate Jhasso has been acting up again. He tried to escape from his room, so we moved him to the basements. I don't understand why we just don't kill the meat.~
/* #976 */
@4    = ~We need his knowledge on how this organization works, otherwise we'd be quickly discovered.~

@21   = ~What do you mean?~
@22   = ~Jhasso and the others are behaving so strangely lately. I don't think they are themselves any more.~
@23   = ~And people have disappeared without a trace. And now, no one seems to have ever known them. That... *pant* that's not *normal*. I'll leave this city as soon as possible.~
