@2    = ~What are you... what are you doing? OH! You're a THIEF aren't you?! That is SO funny! Mother would have an absolute fit if she knew you were here. Here... let me get this!~
@3    = ~There. I TOLD them this lock was broken but they never listen to me. Go ahead and take it. This will probably cause quite the stir, but I really don't care. I'm alright with anything to the disadvantage of this Sarevok fellow. Better go now. Don't want them finding you here.~
@4    = ~Oh, I'm Nila. My mother is downstairs because of the Duke's election of this Sarevok.~
@5    = ~By all accounts this Sarevok seems to be the choice of the landowners as one of the new Dukes. But I can't stand him, he's a bad guy. Mommy believes he'll plunge us into a war against Amn.~
@6    = ~Um, who are you again?~
@7    = ~Farewell. Stop by if the celebration should be too boring for you.~
@8    = ~Who are you?~
