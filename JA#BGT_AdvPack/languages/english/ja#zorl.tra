@4    = ~Could we ask you a few questions?~
@5    = ~Well. Then enjoy your stay in this house. If you would excuse me, I'm busy.~
@6    = ~Rather not. I'm really very busy.~
@7    = ~Ah, finally! I can hardly wait for the feast. Zzsss - so hungry.~
@8    = ~Aah, you've made it in time for the festivities. It'll be best if you go and fetch Aldeth so we can surprise him. As his old childhood friend that honor belongs to you, of course.~
@9	  = ~Very well, I'll be going.~
