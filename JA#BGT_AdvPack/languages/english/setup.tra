@1000 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

The famous nightly ghost song at the Elfsong tavern has been silent for some time. I offered, the owner "Lady" Alyth Elendara, to search for clues and to find out what has happened. Maybe some of the guests of the Elfsong know more and can shed some light onto the subject. Right now I'm still don't have any clues.~
@1001 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

None of the guests could tell me much about the disappearance of the ghost's voice. But apparently the former owner of the Elfsong has shown a special interest in the singing elf lady. Maybe this is a clue.~
@1002 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

Nathan told me, for a small fee, that old Wilyn now lives in a small house north of the big tower on the eastern side of the harbor entrance, next to a small tavern.~
@1003 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

I talked to Wilyn. It turned out that he had nothing to do with the disappearance of the ghostly voice from Elfsong. However, he did speak about a prominent guest, who had an old, unplayable harp with three strings, and who was very angry when he was thrown out of the tavern. Not exactly a hot track, strange folks are very common in the Elfsong. I will speak again with the guests in the tavern. Maybe I missed something.~
@1004 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

Bekki, the barmaid of Elfsong, gave me the name of the mage with the strange harp - Vaalahor. But he has not done anything suspect. Probably all this searching leads nowhere in the end. Too bad, I would also have liked to hear the ghost song once.~
@1005 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

I met the mage Vaalahor at the Sorcerous Sundries. It turned out that he had tried to bind the voice of the Elfsong to a harp with a spell. Something probably went wrong. Now we "only" have to get the voice out of the instrument and back to the tavern.~
@1006 = ~The mystery of the silent ghostly voice

In the upper floor of the Elfsong the spirit of the elven lady appeared to me. She seemed to speak to her missing love and only noticed me vaguely. When her manifestation dissolved again, the harp of Vaalahor went with her. I think that the lady should have gotten her voice back. Now I just have to report to Alyth of my success.~

I have been witness to sad events within the Firewine ruins. An ex-paladin by the name of Svlast is being hunted by the spirit of his brother in the faith, whom he wrongfully killed.

@1010 = ~Krammoch Arkhstaff and the Iron Throne

I have promised Krammoch Arkhstaff to spare the life of Thaldorn Tenhevich when I visit the headquarters of the Iron Throne. The two seem to be quite close.~

The unfortunate paladin Svlast is dead. Even if this is the end he had wished for, this event fills me with sadness. It seems impossible to keep away the melancholic mood in these ruins.~
@1012 = ~Scar's assassination

Jhasso asked us to find out what is going on with the mysterious illness of the Grand Duke Eltan. He fears a plot and he thinks it might be linked with Scar's murder. He suggested that we should conduct an investigation in the Blushing Mermaid, because there might be clues about Scar's murder.~
@1013 = ~Scar's assassination

Jhasso believes that the doppelgangers, who are responsible for Scar's death, were also behind Eltan's mysterious illness. I should immediately pay him a visit in the headquarters of the Flaming Fist.~
@1014 = ~Scar's assassination

In his corner of the Blushing Mermaid Tavern, Ivanne charges 10 gp for the chance to hear his morbid tale. Scar has been murdered in my absence, it seems, and should I ever wish to hear the details of his death, they like as not shall come from Ivanne's mouth. It would be good to return here when I have more time to listen.~

@1015 = ~Scar's assassination

I have listened to the tale of Ivanne, sole witness to Scar's death, save his killer. Judging by Ivanne's telling, Scar was lured to his horrific death by yet another doppelganger, no doubt in the hire of the Iron Throne, though Ivanne thought Angelo might have good cause. Scar's passing was mercifully brief, at least, though more for reasons of stealth than of compassion. Aye, I have seen so many of these foul mirrorkin of late but I pray I never become accustomed to their cursed, shifting faces. If I should get to the bottom of this murder, there are only two places I can think of searching: the tower of the Iron Throne or the barracks of the Flaming Fist, where Duke Eltan is said to lie in sickly pallor. All else, it seems, is meaningless.~

@1019 = ~Krammoch Arkhstaff and the Iron Throne

Krammoch Arkhstaff was very pleased that I spared dear Thaldorn when I searched the Iron Throne. He offered me his help whenever I would need it. I wonder if Krammoch and Thaldorn now have to fear the vengeance of the other leaders of the Iron Throne?~
@1020 = ~A guard in Beregost spoke of a reward of 5000 gold coins. However, he did not say on what it is for.~

@1023 = ~The seduced uncle Ragefast

I met Jopi, a traveler from the Friendly Arm, in Baldur's Gate. He is worried about his Uncle Ragefast, who apparently got his head turned by some young girl. During my travels, I have indeed not encountered true love too many times, this could be a nice break from the monotony of my adventures...~
@1024 = ~Xzar's instigators

We have apparently met Xzar's commissioners in Baldur's Gate. They are agents of the Zhentarim. They too are enemies of the Iron Throne and may prove useful allies. Niemain, their leader, is waiting for further reports from Xzar in the Elfsong.~
@1025 = ~Investigating the Merchant's League

Doppelgangers in the Merchant's League! Obviously Aldeth's business partners Zorl and Irlentree were replaced by shape-changing creatures. That would explain their strange behavior recently.~
@1026 = ~Investigating the Merchant's League

The cook of the League told me that Zorl and Irlentree have been behaving strangely for some time. They eat and sleep no more. Something strange is happening here.~
@1027 = ~Investigating the Merchant's League

Irlentree has returned from the preparations for Aldeth's anniversary and has requested all guests to go to the third floor. Now that they're all distracted, maybe I can poke around the rest of the building undisturbed.~
@1028 = ~Investigating the Merchant's League

I've met Zorl Miyar, a business partner of Aldeth. I had the feeling that he did not buy our story about us being childhood friends of Aldeth. Perhaps he suspects something.~
@1029 = ~Investigating the Merchant's League

Having charmed Deagan, I learned that there was a lot of unrest in the Merchant's league.~
@1030 = ~Investigating the Merchant's League

I've learned that Zorl and Irlentree are behaving odd lately, and that they are driving the Merchant's League into ruin with their businesses, as if they would deliberately try to harm the organization.~
@1031 = ~It appears that the elven spirit voice, which has made the tavern "Elfsong" so famous has remained silent for some time. No one seems to know the reason. From what I've heard the voice is of indescribable beauty and anyone who dares to put his foot in Elfsong, should take the time to listen to it. Who knows, maybe the ghost singing will return in a few days on its own.~
@1032 = ~The problems of the Thieves' Guild

The Flaming Fist has recently cracked down pretty hard on the Thieves' Guild.~
@1033   = ~Attack on the caravan

The wounded merchant died. I should have helped him sooner to save him.~




@2000 = ~The history of this weapon lost its significance in the great ocean of stories that are told about the High Forest, but the song of the outstanding archer Adaniss Rhyte is still sung by many bards:

Shocked by the power of his bow
Quickly falls the game struck by Adaniss
Many years ago at the time of the Quiet Earth
During the hunt in the legendary High Forest.

The Duke of Everlund always boasted very much
The trophies, which he lined up
But his anger was inflamed by another hunter
Whose prey of a year exceeded his own.

A dark tragedy befell one morning the land
The death of the Duke's most magnificent dog.
Fallen at the foot of a great elm tree
The arrow still stuck in its throat.

With a keen eye, he found the game fore sure.
His hands firm and graceful
Aiming at the fey target
No shot was too difficult for Adaniss Rhyte.

That same evening Adaniss turned to the Duke.
To atone for grave mistake that he had made.
But the anger of the nobleman demanded ten pounds of meat
And they pulled the archer's arm out of its joints.

Unlawfulness for justice demands the Duke
The worst spell cursing his arm.
He sought revenge for price he had paid
And so Rhyte swore the arrow for the dog was not the last.

Worried the city helped forge an ax
Blessed to prove him the honor a famed day.
The scar of Rhytes arrow as a guide for the ax
And they say, it also kills with one hit.

With a keen eye, he found the game fore sure.
His hands firm and graceful
Aiming at the fey target
No shot was too difficult for Adaniss Rhyte.

Again, the Forest called with its precious wild
In search of prey  Adaniss roamed the lands.
The Blood Falcon was the price that he wanted
And on the Lost Peaks was where he would find it.

Once again, the rivalry of the Duke was stirring
Confident of his strength with the bow of Rhyte
His focus on the magnificent bird
The next heir is safe from all harm.

Both climbed the summit and sought for endless days
Their will power was of the strength of stones.
They met by chance at a rocky cliff
Both full of hatred running deep in their bones.

With a keen eye, he found the game fore sure.
His hands firm and graceful
Aiming at the fey target
No shot was too difficult for Adaniss Rhyte.

The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string
But before flew Adaniss' ax so very quick.
His skull split, the Duke stumbled to the rocky edge and fell
Defeated by Rhytes last arrow...

With a keen eye, he found the game fore sure.
His hands firm and graceful
Aiming at the fey target
No shot was too difficult for Adaniss Rhyte.
No shot was too difficult for Adaniss Rhyte.

Although he was a skilled blacksmith, his real skill was to whistle a soulful song that could bring a seasoned man to cry like a child. Only a reclusive mage spent his time with the little person, while the others only made fun of his small size. The song of the blacksmith met only deaf ears because of their prejudices, and their cruel mockery grew into torment, and so the discouraged man found himself finally urged to leave his home for good. Before his departure he forged this weapon as a gift for his friend, who enchanted it during the manufacturing. The blade whistles a sweet tune to its wearer when it is drawn from its sheath. Shortly after the mage also left the small town in disgust, taking the sword on his travels.

There he reached into emptiness and his will power shaped the blade out of nowhere. Whatever the truth may be: In the right hands, it is a fearsome weapon.
