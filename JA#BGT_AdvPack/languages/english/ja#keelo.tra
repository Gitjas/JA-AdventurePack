@2    = ~Here, take this healing potion.~
@3    = ~I have an Elixir of Health for you. This will help you.~
@4    = ~Here, take these Good Berries.~
@5    = ~Let's see what we can do for you. Hold still for a second.~
@6    = ~Unfortunately, that was all we can do for you.~
@7    = ~So, now that you're responsive again: Give us gold and valuables, or we'll cut your throat!~
@8    = ~Damn leg! I'll show these gnolls... *moan*... this pain.~
/* #15043 */
@9    = ~I still feel a little light-headed, but I should be able to make it back to Beregost under my own power. Here, take my axe. It's too heavy for me to carry right now anyway.~

@11   = ~You have been generous with your healing... Here, those gnolls didn't find this old amulet that I keep tucked into my boot. I hope it's enough of a repayment for your kindness. If you ever want to stop by and visit, I have a place in Beregost.~

@12   = ~Upon restoring Keelor to consciousness, the battered dwarf informed me of the presence of gnolls in the area. As has been made clear to me by Keelor's condition, they are becoming an ever-increasing threat.

@13   = ~You have been more than kind to a rough and battered dwarf. My sister, Nasha, is a cleric in the southern quarter of Baldur's Gate. If you ever need this favor returned, find her there and she will heal you.~

@14   = ~Upon restoring Keelor to consciousness, the battered dwarf informed me that the gnolls have been increasing their presence in the area. As has been made clear to me by Keelor's condition, they represent a growing threat.
