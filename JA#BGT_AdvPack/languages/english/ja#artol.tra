@0    = ~Helm has granted me your timely assistance! Come, fight your way to my side and let us purge these sewers of this plague!~

@3    = ~I thank you for your assistance in this fight. So the gods want it, we'll meet again.~
@4    = ~Farewell, Sir Artolas.~
@5    = ~No way! Give me your sword and your armor or your corpse will joine the other here below!~
@6    = ~Well, well, the expected help turns out to be another test. Well, this should be a lesson to you!~
