/* jastey's notes:
Install order bgqe - bg1npc - bg1re - GToaT - bg1ub - JAP - Xvart Caverns

-Bardolan: with JAP installed after bg1re (and bg1npc if the interjections fire), Bardolan vanishes after the first meeting at the bridge. JAP patches the script block so he respawns either for no bg1re encounter or after the bg1re encounter run

-Aldeth & Seniyad: with Viconia in the group, the reply option added by JAP that soothes the fight is lost because of her interjection into ALDETH 5 by bg1npc. I inserted a STATE_WHICH_SAYS workaround that should work. Still, this contruction is fragile if other mods add I_C_T before JAP or bg1npc changes its interjections, so this should be monitored with regard to this.

-Also Aldeth: if player choses to sooth the conflict, the dialogue will loop back to the Bg1NPC Jaheira quest from Seniyad concerning the shadow druids. This, too, is realised by STATE_WHICH_SAYS and an INTERJECT into a JAP mod dialogue state (upon installation). This only works for the above install order.


-Xvart Caverns extends on the Xvarts and gives Hulrik a thank you dialogue after the mod content is finished. I made the two compatible: the PC can first raid the mines and the Xvart village and tell Hulrik. Then he can play the extended Xvart caverns and tell Hulrik about that, too.

-To make the Hulrik component compatible with other mods adding content for Hulrik, the "always true" random dialogue states where not given a WEIGHT (i.e. deactivated - they will not show). The original always true dialogue HULRIK 4 is unchanged, and therefore can be outweighted by other mods if wanted.

-to make Ramazith / Abela compatible with bg1re's "Necromancer's Trouble", reply options added to states 15 and 17 were removed, i.e. reply options were only added to states that already *have* reply options

-Garrick, Tales of a Troubadour: if the conflict between the dryad and the woodcutters is settled peacefully, Garrick will receive is improved flute.



***
general ideas for mod update:
- more looping back to existing dialogue states if possible, to give other mods a chance to add their content. This goes for the aditions to the merchant's league, as well.

-separation into single components. Especially for the restaurations which are added by bg1ub or NTotSC, as well. But also to give the player a better choice. Possible division into Tweaks that change/alter/restore (e.g. the name of Nashkel Inn, added thieves to Silence's shop, but also candle animations etc) and own components for all quest related changes (restored encounters/quest or improved quests etc.)

-note: chapter numbers are BGT-numbers! If converted to OUTER_SPRINTS, use the bgt cmpvars. Same for dlg names etc.

-use argent77's macro to make journal entry strref reading fail-proof.

-move removal of rep increase in Noralee's dialogue into a separate "tweak" component? Same for Ramazith's XP and rep reduction (currently commented)



----
notes to BG:EE compatibility:

-"Noralee": component would also be BG:EE compatible. Is compatible with BG1 NPC.

-Aldeth Sashenstar and the Mearchants' League: the quest inside the Merchants' League does not need to be transformed. BG:EE restored the cutscene inside the Mearchants' League.
Same for Aldeth's sellout: is already included in BG:EE.

Content that could be added to BG:EE is the move of Aldeth into the Three Old Kegs (after meeting Deagan), and the dialogue after meeting Aldeth again after his sellout.

(no other components checked for BG:EE compatibility, yet)
